# BASFFrontend
FrontEnd

I have used Cucumber and Selenium because they are the best frameworks in the market to automatize webpages.

Before running, check chromdriver is compatible with your chrome.

Run TestRunner in your Eclipse
2 first scenarios will pass , third one will fail.

This is a first approach and i will be glad about how to defend my position.
